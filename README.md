# KingSize

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.4.

## Goal
It is a dog-eat-dog world. 
But luckily we can now atleast give the poor doggos some more walks in the parks! 

Or atleast that is what we aim to do.
In this repository you'll find the beginning of an amazing dog-walking app.
It's a Tinder meets dogswalks! 

Meet local dogs (perhaps single) in your area and threat them on a nice walk. 
Or get your dog to meet local people (perhaps single also?) in your area so it can threat the human for some nice exercise! 
Win-win, right?

Stay in touch if you want to find out what this infant app grows up to be. :)  

## To Do
- Create an online database instead of local
- Finish up matching
- Get a list with all the matches
- Link the matches to a chatbox
- Create a calendar so the matches can schedule a walking date

## Tools
Angular
Angular Material
NodeJS
Express
MySQL

## Result
